## TODO

- instructions to boot/test the app
- tests
- styles
- pull auth stuff out of homeview, moving it somewhere more
  generic?
- title / description for docs
- different env stuff for deploy (instead of hardcoded junk)
- get jwt token out of URL (improve auth flow)
- sign out
- figure out middleware and use it for api requests
- in general, use redux everywhere possible
- public viewable file
- bonus: let users convert videos to gifs
