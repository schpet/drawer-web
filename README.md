# Drawer Client

based off a [react redux starter kit][kit].

[kit]: https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit


## TODO

main:

1. refactor stuff to use api middleware
2. deploy this thing

other:

- instructions to boot/test the app
- tests
- styles
- pull auth stuff out of homeview, moving it somewhere more
  generic?
- title / description for docs
- different env stuff for deploy (instead of hardcoded junk)
- get jwt token out of URL (improve auth flow)
- sign out
- in general, use redux everywhere possible
- public viewable file
- filter/graph by mime type
- make the entire screen the drag + drop target on every page, when logged in
- render on the server ("isomorphic") for opengraph tags, faster rendering
- bonus: let users convert videos to gifs
